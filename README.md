# Zshs üåü

[![Build Status](https://github.com/vuon9/zshs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vuon9/zshs/actions)

Utility functions for Zsh uses.

## Installation üì¶

- Requisites: Go 1.20

Clone to local and use Go to build it:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:vuon9/zshs.git
cd zshs
go install ./cmd/zshs
```

Then it can be used anywhere by just typing `zshs`

## Features ‚ú®

### Search a plugin command üîç
I often found myself struggling to recall specific Zsh plugin commands. To avoid constantly referring to online cheat sheets, here is a search function:

```bash
zshs kubectl 'get pods'
zshs git 'pull --rebase'
```
